plutoControl  
Contains 3 cpp-files and 3 header-files.
The main program is found in mainControl.cpp.

	mainControl
	Contains scannerCallback, main

		scannerCallback
		Function which is called when the scanner publish values.
		Uses the input and sets the parameters of the closestObject.

		main
		Subcribes to Laserscan.
		Call upon functions in closestObjectFunctions.cpp and kbQuiting.cpp and publish the results from these to the atrv/cmd_vel. Ends if either ROS or the user has stopped the program.

	closestObjectFunctions.cpp
	Contains lengthRangesInt, setClosestObject,  reactToObject

		lengthRangesInt
		Returns the number of values in scan, i.e. the number of angles Pluto has sent back.

		setClosestObject
		Goes through the distance values and determines the value, angle and index of the closest objcet, i.e. the one with smallest distance. Sets theese values as the parameters of closestObject and returns the object.

		reactToObject
		Sets rotational and translational speed for Pluto based on the distance and angle to the closest object. 
		Returns the values in twist.

	kbQuiting.cpp
	Contains kbhit, kbQuit

		kbhit
		Returns 1 if a button on the keyboard was pressed and 0 otherwise.

		kbQuit
